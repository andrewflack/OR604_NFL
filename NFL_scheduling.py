####### ENHANCEMENT 1 CONSTRAINTS #######

# 11 - No team plays more than two road games against teams coming off their BYE
# see pg 71 in notebook

# 12 - New York Teams donâ€™t want to play late home games on Yom Kippur and 
# Rosh Hashanah

# 13 - There are two Monday night games on week 1

# 14 - There is only one Monday night game during weeks 2 through 16

# 15 - The home team for the late Monday night game on week 1 will be a team 
# one of the following five teams (ARI, SD, SF, OAK, SEA)

# 16 - There is only one Thursday night game during weeks 1 through 16

# 17 - There is only one Sunday night game scheduled during weeks 1 through 16

# 18 - There will be two Saturday Night games, one each night in weeks 15 
# and 16 (The Saturday rule depends on how many Saturdays there are in 
# December and in which month week 17 falls.  Basically, if Thanksgiving 
# is week 12, then there are Saturday Night games during weeks 15 and 16.  
# If Thanksgiving occurs in week 13, there are two Saturday games - one early 
# and one late - that happen during week 16).

# 19 - Superbowl champion opens the season at home on Thursday night of week 1

# 20 - There are two Thanksgiving Day games: DET hosts the early game and 
# DAL hosts the late game.  (The networks alternate each year who gets the 
# early game and who gets the late game)
